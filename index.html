										<p>"Hello World!"</p>
											<p>Can we even imagine today‚Äôs life without numbers? A big ‚ÄòNo‚Äô, Right? Numbers have the capability to extract hidden untold stories. I love numbers, I love Math & to be creative with them. Hence, my passion for data science landed me in the course of Artificial Intelligence & Data Science. Before that, I worked at Reliance Industries Limited, Hazira Manufacturing Division as a Manager for 3 years where my major job role included manpower management, Daily planning & prioritize of the job, SAP for material management, and Critical thinking to improve production efficiency. One of the major projects I worked on was to build an Oxygen line to supply oxygen to Surat city from the plant during the covid time. We did it within just 2 days which was a proud moment for us.

												During AI & DS, I learned various subjects such as Deep Learning, Machine learning, Probability & Statistics, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Database & Data warehouse, and Data visualization. At present, I‚Äôm also working on research related to the Entropy function in Decision trees. Apart from academic life, I‚Äôm a cyclist,I love to play piano, football, chess & meditation. 
																						
											 </p>
											<p>I always wanted to work for humanity, which can improve lifestyle of not only humans but every living being. In my view, no other fields can do better job than data science when it comes to productivity of life. Hence, I felt this field is best alignment of my passion & my life goal. I‚Äôm very curious & excited to implement my knowledge to industry.

											<h3 class="major">Avg Distance Between 2 Points(in N-Dimensions)</h3>							
											<p>The screenshot is from the famous book "HandsOn ML with SkLearn, Keras & TensorFlow".I was reading this book & I came to this paragraph. It was tough to visualize these numbers & I found it counterintuitive! Hence, I started the laptop & tried to code it. I got the exact average distance between 2 points in 1,000,000 dimension space 408.25 units! Such an Aha moment! </p>

											<p> Sepsis is a serious medical condition that requires early detection and prediction to improve patient outcomes. Machine learning can be used to analyze patient data and identify patterns to predict sepsis. A sepsis prediction project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to monitor patients and identify those at risk of developing sepsis. The goal is to improve patient outcomes and reduce sepsis-related deaths.

											</h3>							
											<p>This project aims to scrape the skills listed on resumes and match them to job roles to identify how many skills a candidate has that are suitable for a particular job. The project would likely involve the use of web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy, as well as natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as bigram and trigram to extract the skills from resumes and match them to job roles.
